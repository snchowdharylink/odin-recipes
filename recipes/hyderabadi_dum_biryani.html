    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise,
        and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely
        chopped.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice,
        ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric
        in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic
        wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked
        through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat.
        Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on
        paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile
        peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove
        1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to
        the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per
        side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice.
        Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to
        low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let
        stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15
        minutes.

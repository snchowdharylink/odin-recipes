    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rasgulla, also known as Rosogolla, Rosgola, or Rasagola is a South Asian
      syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South
      Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian
      cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of
      sugar.This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.

    <h2>Ingredients (Servings: 20 piece)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>6 cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming;
        immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You
        should see the milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a
        colander lined with cheesecloth; rinse the chenna with cold water to get
        rid of the lime juice. Allow the water to drain completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as
        possible; what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a
        rolling mat or other smooth surface. Knead the paneer well to make a
        smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the water to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the
        boiling water until dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms,
        making sure there are no cracks; gently drop the balls into the hot
        syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure.
        Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release the pressure from the cooker while running under water; remove
        the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded
        2 or 3 times in size. Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently
        stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely
        before serving cold.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kheer (kheeri, payesh, payox, payasam or phirni) is a sweet dish and a
      type of wet pudding popular in the Indian subcontinent, usually made by
      boiling milk, sugar or jaggery, and rice, although rice is sometimes
      substituted with one of the following: daals, bulgur wheat, millet,
      tapioca, vermicelli, or sweet corn.

      It is typically flavoured with desiccated coconut, cardamom, raisins,
      saffron, cashews, pistachios, almonds, or other dry fruits and nuts, and
      recently pseudograins are also gaining popularity.
